# Semaphore

Semaphore is an extensible dashboard for viewing Prometheus time series, built with Laravel, Tailwind and VueJS.

Out-of-the-box it can monitor global uptime, performance (CPU, memory usage, disk I/O), disk space, SSL certificates and software versions.

Semaphore also allows you to configure notifications, which can be set when certain values pass a preset threshold.
